# Consolidation-Project
The gameâ€™s goal is to score the most points or reach a target score first. Players roll three dice. If all three dice match, the player "tupled out" and scores zero. Two matching dice are "fixed." Players can re-roll non-fixed dice until they stop or tuple out, scoring the sum of the dice or zero.
